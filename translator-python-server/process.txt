Walkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
*newline*Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
*newline*Everybody here wanted somethin' more
*newline*Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
*newline*And it said
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
*newline*It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
*newline*The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
*newline*When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
*newline*Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
*newline*Everybody here was someone else before
*newline*And you can want who you want
*newline*Boys and boys and girls and girls
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
*newline*It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
*newline*The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
*newline*Welcome to New York (New York!)
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
*newline*Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
*newline*Like any real love, it's ever-changing
*newline*Like any true love, it drives you crazy
*newline*But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
*newline*It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat
*newline*The lights are so bright but they never blind me
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*New soundtrack
*newline*It's been waitin' for you
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*The lights are so bright but they never blind me
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*So bright, they never blind me
*newline*Welcome to New York
*newline*Welcome to New York*newline*
